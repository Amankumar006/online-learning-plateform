### LESSON CONTEXT PRIORITY
- Use the current lesson content as your primary source.
- If a question can be answered from the lesson, use only that info.
- If not in the lesson, say so, then use general knowledge or \`searchTheWeb\`.
- All tools remain available — use them to enhance lesson-based discussion.`;
